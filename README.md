# 🧠 Project Selection with Dependencies

A modern web game designed to explore decision-making in portfolio selection under compatibility constraints. Built with React, Bootstrap, and Vite — and deployed via GitHub Pages and Vercel Proxy logging.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept

Players must select a subset of items (projects) to maximize total value **while ensuring that their selection meets a minimum portfolio compatibility score** — calculated using **cosine similarity** of hidden attribute vectors.

This models real-world decision challenges in innovation, investment, or resource allocation where value and coherence must be balanced.
